## 🔍 What This Tool Does

### 🎯 Primary Function
**Automated Web Application Security Testing** for educational purposes

### 🛡️ Vulnerability Detection
- **SQL Injection**: Database attack detection
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: Script injection testing
- **Command Injection**: System command execution
- **Directory Traversal**: File system access
- **Sensitive File Exposure**: Configuration file leaks
- **Security Headers**: Missing protection headers
- **SSL/TLS Issues**: Certificate problems

### 📊 Detailed Reporting
Each vulnerability includes:
- 🎯 **Payload Used**: Exact attack string
- 🔍 **Vulnerable Parameter**: Which input is affected  
- ⚠️ **Risk Level**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
- 🏥 **How to Fix**: Specific mitigation steps
- 🔓 **Attack Method**: How hackers exploit it

## 🎓 Educational Value

### 📚 Learn About:
- Web application vulnerabilities
- Penetration testing techniques
- Security best practices
- Attack vectors and payloads
- Defense mechanisms

### 🔬 Payload Examples:
```sql
-- SQL Injection
' OR 1=1--
admin'--
' UNION SELECT password FROM users--
```

```html
<!-- XSS Attacks -->
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
<img src=x onerror=alert('Stolen')>
```

```bash
# Command Injection
; cat /etc/passwd
| whoami
& dir
```

## ⚠️ Legal & Ethical Usage

### ✅ ALLOWED:
- Your own websites
- Test/lab environments
- Educational purposes
- Authorized penetration testing
- Security research

### ❌ PROHIBITED:
- Unauthorized website testing
- Malicious hacking
- Illegal activities
- Violating terms of service

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Python not found"
**Solution**: Install Python
1. Go to https://python.org/downloads/
2. Download Python 3.11+
3. ✅ Check "Add Python to PATH"
4. Install and restart terminal

### Problem: "Module not found"
**Solution**: Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Problem: "Port already in use"
**Solution**: Change port in `app/main.py`
```python
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)  # Change 5000 to 8080
```

### Problem: Scan takes too long
**Cause**: Rate limiting (intentional)
- Tool uses delays to avoid detection
- Large payload lists take time
- Network timeouts are normal

## 🎯 How to Use

### Step 1: Start the Tool
- Double-click `start.bat` (Windows)
- Or run `python launcher.py`

### Step 2: Access Web Interface
- Open browser to http://localhost:5000
- Modern, responsive interface

### Step 3: Enter Target URL
- Input: `https://example.com`
- Must be a website you own/have permission to test

### Step 4: Review Results
- Severity levels: Critical → High → Medium → Low
- Detailed explanations for each finding
- Specific remediation advice

## 📈 Advanced Features

### 🔌 API Access
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/scan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://yoursite.com"}'
```

### 📊 Export Results
Results can be accessed via API for integration with other tools

### 🎚️ Configuration
Edit `config.py` for custom settings:
- Request timeouts
- Payload limits
- Rate limiting delays
